Goal
========================================================

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

- A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
- A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.


Overview
========================================================

- The purpose is to create a Shiny app interfacemthat will be able to predicts the user text input via algorithms that were code in R.

- By entering a word, the input, in the textbox a following text, an output will appear.

Algorithms 
========================================================

- The word that will be predicted will be based on a bigram, trigram and quadgram matrix.
- The word with the highest frequency will be suggested by the algorithm.
- Please note that the words are in english only. The code remove all special characters, spaces and replace all the letters to lowcases.
